('SPRING BOOT vs SPRING FRAMEWORK','some description',
'Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss.
Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.',
'The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform.
The framework core features can be used by any Java application,
but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.
Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model, it has become popular in the Java community as an addition to,
or even replacement for the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model');
